                                <h3>So Many Choices</h3>
                                When trying to decide on the best type of bike, think about these questions:

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Who do you ride with? </li>
                                    <li> What do they ride?</li>
                                    <li> What have you had in the past that you liked?</li>
                                    <li>What have you had in the past that you disliked?</li>
                                    <li> Where would you like to ride your new bike?</li>
                                </ul>
                                If you are buying a bike to ride with a group of friends, buy something similar to what
                                they
                                ride.
                                You will not be able to keep up with road bikes if you are on a mountain bike or
                                cruiser.
                                And a
                                road
                                bike cannot go on the dirt or the sand.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                If you enjoyed a three speed as a child, you may find this a fun bike again. If you
                                disliked
                                the
                                road
                                bike you bought a few years ago, perhaps a mountain bike would be better.

                                <h3>Road Bikes</h3>
                                <br>
                                Road bicycles are designed to be ridden fast on smooth pavement. They have smooth,
                                skinny
                                tires
                                and "drop"
                                handlebars, and can be used for on-road racing. They are usually lighter than other
                                types of
                                bicycles. They
                                can be ridden on paved trails, but most people find them uncomfortable and unstable on
                                unpaved
                                trails. Most
                                road bikes are not capable of carrying heavy loads, so are not very suitable for
                                commuting
                                or
                                touring.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <h3>Mountain Bikes</h3>
                                <br>
                                Mountain Bicycles are design for riding rough off-road trails. They have flat or upright
                                handlebars, and a very
                                low gear range for pedaling up steep trails. Most mountain bikes have some type of shock
                                absorbers or suspension.
                                Mountain bikes with front suspension only are called hardtails; mountain bikes with both
                                front
                                and rear suspension
                                are called full-suspension bikes or duallies. Mountain bikes with no suspension are
                                called
                                rigid. Mountain bikes
                                can be outfitted for use as touring or commuting bikes, although they would not be as
                                light
                                or
                                efficient as traditional
                                touring or commuting bikes. Fat bikes, with their extremely wide tires, are included in
                                the
                                mountain bike category.

                                <h3>City Bikes</h3>
                                <br>
                                The term "city bike" doesn't really refer to a specific category of bikes; it's more of
                                a
                                general descriptive term.
                                They might also be called "commuter" or "urban" bikes, although many of the bikes listed
                                on
                                this
                                page can be used quite
                                well for riding and commuting in a city. However, there is a certain type of bike that
                                some
                                people have in mind when they
                                use the term "city bike." This bike has characteristics of both a hybrid bike and a
                                cruiser
                                bike--usually the upright riding
                                position of a cruiser, but the wheel size of a hybrid bike.

                                A city bike might also have some or all of these features that make it more amenable to
                                riding
                                in regular clothes, as opposed
                                to cycling-specific clothing:

                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Chain guard
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Skirt guard on rear wheel
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <br>
                                A city bike might also have an internally-geared rear hub for ease of use and
                                maintenance,
                                and a
                                built-in generator and lights
                                for safety when riding after dark.

                                These bikes are also sometimes called "Dutch bikes," because of their resemblance to the
                                everyday bikes used in Amsterdam and
                                other bike-friendly European cities.

                                        According to experts from Bristol University, the beneﬁts of cycling extend deep
                                        into
                                        your core.

                                        intestine, limiting
                                        the amount of water absorbed back into your body and leaving you with softer
                                        stools,
                                        which are easier to pass,”
                                        explains Harley Street gastroenterologist Dr Ana Raimundo.

                                        In addition, aerobic exercise accelerates your breathing and heart rate, which
                                        helps
                                        to
                                        stimulate the contraction
                                        of intestinal muscles. “As well as preventing you from feeling bloated, this

                                        protect you against bowel cancer,” Dr Raimundo says.

                                        University of
                                        Illinois found that a 5 per cent improvement
                                        in cardio-respiratory ﬁtness from cycling led to an improvement of up to 15 per
                                        cent
                                        in
                                        mental tests.

                                        That’s because cycling helps build new brain cells in the hippocampus – the
                                        region
                                        responsible for memory, which deteriorates from the
                                        age of 30.

                                        “It boosts blood ﬂow and oxygen to the brain, which ﬁres and regenerates
                                        receptors,
                                        explaining how exercise helps ward off Alzheimer’s,”
                                        says the study’s author, Professor Arthur Kramer.

                                        for 30 minutes, ﬁve days a week take about half as many
                                        sick days as couch potatoes.

                                    Every morning Canadian neuroscientist Brian Christie, PhD, gives his brain an extra
                                    boost.
                                    We're not talking about tossing back multiple strong
                                    shots of espresso or playing one of those mind-training games advertised all over
                                    Facebook.
                                    "I hop on my bike, go to the gym for 45 minutes, then
                                    ride the rest of the way to work," says Christie. "When I get to my desk, my brain
                                    is at
                                    peak activity for a few hours." After his mental focus sputters
                                    to a halt later in the day, he jump-starts it with another short spin to run
                                    errands.

                                    Ride, work, ride, repeat. It's a scientifically proven system that unleashes some
                                    unexpected
                                    benefits of cycling. In a recent study in the Journal of
                                    Clinical and Diagnostic Research, scientists found that people scored higher on
                                    tests of
                                    memory, reasoning, and planning after 30 minutes of spinning
                                    on a stationary bike than they did before they rode. They also completed the tests
                                    faster
                                    after pedaling.
